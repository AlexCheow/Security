First Signup an account on Ngrok website then install Ngrok
Run ngrok.exe



Copy the authtoken code from your ngrok account then paste it in ngrok.exe cmd
Example:
ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
Replace YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN with the actual token you received when you signed up.

Run Your Local Server (XAMPP)
Make sure you have a local server running on your computer. For example, if you're running a web app on port 8080, make sure your app is accessible at http://localhost:8080.

Copy "ngrok http 8080" and paste it in Ngrok.exe cmd

Replace 8080 with whatever port your local server is running on (if needed)
Access the Public URL

After running the command, you’ll see something like this in the terminal:

Session Status                online
Account                       Your Name (Plan: Free)
Version                       3.x.x
Region                        United States (us)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://12345.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080
Forwarding                    https://12345.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080


You’ll see two public URLs: one HTTP and one HTTPS (e.g., http://12345.ngrok.io and https://12345.ngrok.io).
These URLs can now be shared with others to access your local server on the internet.
Limitations of Free Plan

Temporary URLs: The URLs provided by ngrok in the free plan are temporary. Each time you restart ngrok, you'll get a new URL.
Limited Connections: Free accounts also have limited connection speeds and concurrency.
If you need a permanent URL or more advanced features (like password protection or custom domains), you’d need to upgrade to a paid ngrok plan.
Example: Exposing a Local Web App
If you have a local web app running on http://localhost:5000, you would run:


Copy code
ngrok http 5000
You’ll then see a URL like http://abcd1234.ngrok.io that you can share with others.

Additional Useful ngrok Commands:
Monitor traffic: You can view incoming requests and responses via ngrok's web interface. By default, it’s accessible at http://127.0.0.1:4040.
Change the region: You can specify a different region for ngrok, such as Europe (eu) or Asia (ap), by running:

Copy code
ngrok http -region=eu 8080
That's it! You should now have your local server running publicly via ngrok on a free plan.
